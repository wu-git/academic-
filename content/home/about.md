# Biography

I am a health care researcher and a biostatistician. I provide analytical solution and qualitative evidence using health care data to facilitate health care quality improvement and promote health care outcome research. 

I received training from both fields: biomedical science and biostatistics. So I think I could also call myself “a data scientist”. My current work includes study design, data and statistical analysis, and data interpretations. I have supported a number of publications in clinical research and health policy. I serve as a statistical reviewer for journals and conference. I use R, SAS and STATA for analytic work, and have many year of experience in survival analysis, prediction models, mixed effect models and causal inference. My interest is to use healthcare big data combined with modern analytic tools to drive improvement in healthcare quality and promote advancement in healthcare and clinical fields.
