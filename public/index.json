Model validation process quantifies how well the model predicts outcomes for future patients. However, there were very few SAS programming examples showing the validation process. We previously developed a generalized mixed effect model that predicts peri-operative blood transfusion from patient characteristics. In this paper, we demonstrate the SAS? techniques that we used to validate such a model. These validation methods include calibration, discrimination and sensitivity analysis using bootstrapping method.\n INTRODUCTION Information of patients’ blood transfusion risk prior to cardiac surgery may help clinicians assess a patient’s condition and facilitate informed decision making [1] . For example, given the prediction of transfusion risk, blood conservation modalities may be undertaken prior to surgery to reduce a patient’s risk of receiving potentially unnecessary blood transfusions [2], which are independently associated with adverse outcomes [3, 4]. To provide a risk assessment tool for blood transfusions, we developed a prediction model based on a patient’s preoperative risk factors from a multi-hospital dataset of more than 20,000 coronary artery bypass grafts procedures. The transfusion rate was 36.8% in our data. This model identified 16 preoperative predictors, and accounted for hospitals as random effects [5]. After model development, model validation is a critical step to assess the model performance [6]. The model performance in aspects of model calibration, discrimination and sensitivity analysis were assessed using SAS?. Previously the data was randomly split into model development dataset and model validate dataset. We used a development dataset for variable selection and functional form assessment. We used a validation dataset to assess the model performance. We finally used the large dataset (i.e., development combined with validation datasets) to obtain more stable parameter estimates. The following procedures can be applied to the internal or external validation dataset to validate the model performance.\n CALIBRATION Calibration demonstrates the agreement between observed outcomes and predictions. Here, the calibration plot has the predicted probability by deciles on the x-axis, and the observed rates by deciles on the y-axis. A good calibration should lie close to a 45-degree line.\nFirst, we used OUTPUT statement to obtain the prediction from our mixed effect model. Option (NOBLUP) is used to exclude the predictors of the random effects when calculating the predicted probability for each patient. In this model, we have 16 predictors. These predictors were chosen by model selection as well as their clinical relationship with blood transfusion. In this model, subject=STS_hospnpi fits the random hospital effect. We also used STORE statement to obtain the model estimate to “parameter_dat” dataset.\n/*******output prediction from the mixed effect model ****/ proc glimmix data=mix_model; class bsa4c (ref=\u0026quot;LT1.6\u0026quot;) albumin_3c (ref=\u0026quot;\u0026gt;3.5\u0026quot;) female (ref=\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;) ef4cat (ref=\u0026quot;60%+\u0026quot;) crealst4c (ref=\u0026quot;LT0.8\u0026quot;) race3c (ref=\u0026quot;White\u0026quot;) status3c (ref=\u0026quot;Elective\u0026quot;) vd3 (ref=\u0026quot;No\u0026quot;) chf_ (ref=\u0026quot;No\u0026quot;) pvd_ (ref=\u0026quot;No\u0026quot;) cvd_ (ref=\u0026quot;No\u0026quot;) dialysis_ (ref=\u0026quot;No\u0026quot;) prior_cv(ref=\u0026quot;No\u0026quot;) STS_hospnpi; model rbc = year age bsa4c albumin_3c hct_ hct_gt36_ hct_gt39_ hct_gt43_ female ef4cat crealst4c race3c status3c vd3 chf_ pvd_ cvd_ dialysis_ prior_cv /link=logit dist=bin solution ; random int/ subject=STS_hospnpi; store parameter_dat; output out=pre pred(noblup ilink)=p; run; We then rank the predicted probability into deciles using PROC RANK.

We then plot the calibration plot with the observed transfusion rate in each decile on x axis, and the median prediction probability on y axis. The 45-degree line was added as a reference line. The data points which are represented by circles fall close to the reference line (figure 1). This indicates that the model fits the data well.\n*Plot the calibration Graph; proc sgplot data=merge1; scatter x=observe_p y=median_predict_p; lineparm x=0 y=0 slope=1; /** plot the reference line **/ xaxis grid; yaxis grid; run;  DISCRIMINATION The common measure for model discrimination is the area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve [7]. This is often called a c-statistic, which can be interpreted as the probability that a subject with an observed outcome would have higher probability of predicted outcome than a subject without the observed outcome.\nWe first used the STORE Statement in GLIMMIX to store the parameters from the model development. ILINK was used so that the prediction is at the scale of probability. While GLIMMIX does not have ROC function, we used the predicted probability (variable “Predicted”) and the ROC options in PROC LOGISTIC to generate the ROC curves.\nproc plm restore= parameter_dat; score data=mix_model out=out/ilink;run; proc logistic data=out descending ; model rbc = Predicted; roc; ods output ROCassociation=roc; run;  BOOTSTRAP SAMPLING To assess model performance in different clinical subgroups, bootstrapping sampling can be used [8, 9]. In this example, we generated bootstrap samples by sampling patients with replacement from a defined clinical subgroup. There’re many ways to create bootstrap samples in SAS, including PROC SURVEYSELECT, do loops. After generation of bootstrap samples, we calculated the C-Statistics in each bootstrapping sample, and estimate the bootstrapping mean and variance.\nFor example, one of the important clinical subgroups for blood transfusion is defined by a patient’s admission status (i.e., elective, urgent or emergent). For each admission status, we created 100 bootstrapping samples from the original data. We applied the model estimates to these bootstrapping samples using PROC PLM RESTORE. We then calculated the C-Statistics within each sample. From the bootstrapping samples, we could assess the standard deviation of the C-Statistics. From this sensitivity analysis, we were able to validate how robust our model performance is among different clinical groups.\n/*******create boot samples***/ %macro bootsample(b); data sub1 (where=(status3c=\u0026quot;Elective\u0026quot;)) sub2 (where=(status3c=\u0026quot;Urgent\u0026quot;)) sub3 (where=(status3c=\u0026quot;Emergent\u0026quot;); /* Create one data set for each subgroup */ set mix_model; run; data boot_subgroup; %do t=1 %to 3; do sample=1 to \u0026amp;b; do i = 1 to nobs; pt = round(ranuni(\u0026amp;t)*nobs) ; /* ranuni returns a random number from the uniform distribution on (0,1) interval */ set sub\u0026amp;t nobs = nobs point=pt; output; end; end; %end; stop; run; %mend; %bootsample(100); /********example: model application to the bootstrapping samples of emergent status *****/ %macro combine; %do i=1 %to 100; proc plm restore=parameter_dat; score data=boot_subgroup(where=(sample=\u0026amp;i and status3c=\u0026quot;Emergent\u0026quot;)) out=out\u0026amp;i/ilink;run; proc logistic data=out\u0026amp;i descending ; model rbc = Predicted; roc; ods output ROCassociation=roc\u0026amp;i; %end; run; data roc_test; set %do i=1 %to 100;roc\u0026amp;i %end; where ROCModel=\u0026#39;Model\u0026#39;; run; %mend; %combine; /*** obtain mean and variance for c-statistics of modeling for emergent status*****/ proc means data=roc_test mean std; var area; run; The model c-statistics was then calculated in different clinical subgroup. For example, here is the result of AUC in emergent admission patients from the bootstrap samples.\n CONCLUSION This paper covers some common techniques for validating the performance of a generalized mixed effect model.

The ability of these methods to identify hospital performance outliers in support of quality improvement has not been fully investigated.\nMethods and Results: We leveraged data from patients undergoing coronary artery bypass grafting surgery between 2012-2015 at 33 hospitals participating in a statewide quality collaborative. We applied 5 different statistical approaches (1: indirect standardization with standard logistic regression models, 2: indirect standardization with fixed effect models, 3: indirect standardization with random effect models, 4: direct standardization with fixed effect models, 5: direct standardization with random effect models) to estimate hospital post-operative pneumonia rates, adjusting for patient risk. Unlike the standard logistic regression models, both fixed effect and random effect models accounted for hospital effect. We applied each method to each year, and subsequently compared methods in their ability to identify hospital performance outliers. Pneumonia rates ranged from 0% to 26.2%. The standard logistic regression models for 2013-2015 had c-statistics of 0.73-0.75, fixed effect models had c-statistics of 0.81-0.83, and random effect models had c-statistics of 0.80-0.83. Each method differed in its ability to identify performance outliers. In direct standardization, random effect models stabilized the hospital rates by moving the estimated rates toward the average, fixed effect models produced larger standard errors of hospital effect (e.g., low case volume hospitals). In indirect standardization, the three models showed high agreement on their derived observed/ expected ratio. Indirect standardization with fixed or random effect models identified similar hospital performance outliers in each year.\nConclusions: The surveyed approaches varied in their ability to identify performance outliers. Given its higher sensitivity to outlier hospitals and more stable estimates of hospital effects, indirect standardization methods with random effect models may best support quality improvement activities.\nSlides: See the handout\n","date":1491004800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1491004800,"objectID":"17b3bd27da37339719d8315917d42b84","permalink":"/talk/qcore2017/","publishdate":"2017-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/qcore2017/","section":"talk","summary":"Short title: Identifying hospital performance outliers Xiaoting Wu, Ph.D.1; Min Zhang, Ph.D.2; Richard L.

Increasing levels of the outer mitochondrial membrane protein, 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO), are associated with advancing breast cancer stage. In particular, higher TSPO levels are found in estrogen receptor (ER)-negative breast tumors, compared with ER-positive tumors. In this study, we sought to define the roles of TSPO in the acquisition of breast cancer malignancy. Using a three-dimensional Matrigel culture system, we determined the impact of elevated TSPO levels on mammary epithelial morphogenesis. Our studies demonstrate that stable overexpression of TSPO in mammary epithelial MCF10A acini drives proliferation and provides partial resistance to luminal apoptosis, resulting in enlarged acinar structures with partially filled lumen that resemble early stage breast lesions leading to breast cancer. In breast cancer cell lines, TSPO silencing or TSPO overexpression significantly altered the migratory activity. In addition, we found that combination treatment with the TSPO ligands (PK 11195 or Ro5-4864) and lonidamine, a clinical phase II drug targeting mitochondria, decreased viability of ER-negative breast cancer cell lines. Taken together, these data demonstrate that increases in TSPO levels at different stages of breast cancer progression results in the acquisition of distinct properties associated with malignancy. Furthermore, targeting TSPO, particularly in combination with other mitochondria-targeting agents, may prove useful for the treatment of ER-negative breast cancer.","tags":[],"title":"The 18-kDa translocator protein (TSPO) disrupts mammary epithelial morphogenesis and promotes breast cancer cell migration","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":" Welcome to Slides Academic\nFeatures  Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides  Controls  Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export: E  Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot; if porridge == \u0026quot;blueberry\u0026quot;: print(\u0026quot;Eating...\u0026quot;)  Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = \\;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}}  Press Space to play!\nOne  Two  Three \nA fragment can accept two optional parameters:\n class: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears  Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}}  Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\n Only the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view   Themes  black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links   night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links  Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026quot;/img/boards.jpg\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026quot;#0000FF\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026quot;my-style\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}}  Custom CSS Example Let\u0026rsquo;s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; }  Questions?
