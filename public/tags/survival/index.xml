      <description>One parameter of interest in survival analysis is the median residual at time x.
Recall the definition of survival function, the probability of a subject experiencing the events beyond time x , defined as $S(x)=Pr (X &amp;gt;x) $, X is a continuous random variable.
The pth quantile is found by solving \(S(x_p)=1-p\). For example, the median lifetime is the 50th percentile \(x_{0.5}\), the 75 percentile lifetime is the 70th percentile \(x_{0.</description>
